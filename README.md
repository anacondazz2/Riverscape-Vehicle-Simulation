# river-vehicle-simulation

Made for ICS4U vehicle simulation assignment. Assignment was originally intended for land vehicles, this rendition adds a twist by being based off vehicles on water. The simulation includes battles between opposing navy and pirate ships and their interactions with fisherman and sea burglars traversing the river scape.
